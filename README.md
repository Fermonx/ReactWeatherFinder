React Wheater Finder APP (WIP)

- Run with NPM Start and wait for it to load.

- Go to Openweathermap and register if you want to get and use your own api_key.

- To test a city go to src/components/WeatherFinder/index.js near the top change location and as so ' City, country initials'.

This project is still a work in progress, I'm looking to add either a form so the user can input any city they want from the page or just use geolocation to detect the user location.

The forecast is not working correctly, it will show that its always sunny instead of changing the icon so keep that in mind.
